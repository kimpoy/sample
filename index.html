      <h2>Why Environmental Awareness is important!</h2>
      <p>
        Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness
        around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its
        well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
        earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the
        term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to
        protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As
        previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the
        planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale
        is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these
        human decisions and help the planets health take a complete 180 degree
        in the other direction.

      <h2>Major Environmental Problems</h2>
      <p>
        Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help
        provide food, living space, and other different assets. These creatures
        are called area specific. At the point when the biome is divided, the
        vast patches of living space dont exist anymore. It becomes more
        troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need in order to
        survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant life
        are not there to help sustain it properly.

        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Land Disturbance</h2>
        <p>
          A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage.
          Numerous weedy plant species, for example, garlic & mustard, are both
          foreign and obtrusive. A rupture in the environmental surroundings
          provides for them a chance to start growing and spreading. These
          plants can assume control over nature, eliminating the local greenery.
          The result is a territory with a solitary predominant plant which
          doesn't give satisfactory food assets to all the environmental life.
          Thus the whole environment can be destroyed because of these invasive
          species.

        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Pollution</h2>
        <p>
          Pollution, in whatever form, whether it is air, water, land or noise
          is harmful to the environment. Air pollution pollutes the air that we
          breathe, which causes health issues. Water pollution degrades the
          quality of water that we use for drinking purposes. Land pollution
          results in the degradation of the earth's surface as a result of human
          activities. Noise pollution can cause irreparable damage to our ears
          when exposed to continuous large sounds like honking of vehicles on a
          busy road or machines producing large noise in a factory or a mill.

        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Over Population</h2>
        <p>
          Rapid population growth puts strain on natural resources, which
          results in the degradation of our environment. Mortality rate has gone
          down due to better medical facilities, which has resulted in an
          increased lifespan. More population simply means more demand for food,
          clothes and shelter. You need more space to grow food and provide
          homes to millions of people. This results in deforestation, which is
          another factor in environmental degradation.

        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Landfills</h2>
        <p>
          Landfills pollute the environment and destroy the beauty of the city.
          Landfills come within the city due to the large amount of waste that
          gets generated by households, industries, factories and hospitals.
          Landfills pose a great risk to the health of the environment and the
          people who live there. Landfills produce a foul smell when burned and
          cause substantial environmental degradation.

              burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect”.
